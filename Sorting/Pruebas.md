- What data composes your system and how they interact
- This is the guide that programmers will implement

### Implementation

- IDE's

### Testing

- Developers test their code
- Non-developers test the software

### Deplyoment

- It’s the process of putting the final application in the user’s hands

### Maintenance

- Patches
- Security updates
- Compatibility with newer hardware
- Optimization


## Software Processes (Generic)

Specification → Development → Validation → Evolution
