## Software engineering

Definition:
> Is the usage of proven practices and techniques derived from systems engineering adapting them to address the challenges of software development



### Design

- Design shows <u>every</u> single piece of software: databases, interactions, interfaces
- What data composes your system and how they interact
- This is the guide that programmers will implement

### Implementation

- Write code
- IDE's

### Testing

- Developers test their code
- Non-developers test the software

### Deployment

- It’s the process of putting the final application in the user’s hands

### Maintenance

- Patches
- Security updates
- Compatibility with newer hardware
- Optimization


## Software Processes (Generic)

Specification → Development → Validation → Evolution

### Process model
- Well, it’s how you manage to organize and prioritize activities
- It's what we normally call software development methodologies

## Software Engineering Challenges

### Challenges

1. Heterogenity
	- Different computers
	- More support
	- Different Programming Languages
2. Delivery
	- Faster is better!
3. Trust
	- Users can rely on software

## Software Definition

IEEE Standard 729:
> Is the set of computing programs, processes, rules, documentation and associated data that becomes part of the operations of the system

SOMMERVILLE:
> Computer programs and associated documentation. Software products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market.

### 4 Key Elements for Software

1. Efficiency
	- Consuming just the neccesary
2. Trustability
	- Security, protection stability
3. Usability
	- Intuitive? easy to use
4. Evolution
	- Software will always change, even after deployed

### Ethics
4 basic principles:

1. Confidentiality
	- Respect to clients and employers
2. Competence
	- Don't lie about you
3. Intellectual property rights
	- Libraries, copyright
4.  Computer missuse
	- Pouring malware into someone’s machine
